Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:

<h3>Code #2</h3>

<pre>
Here&#39;s the complete code with the necessary fixes to address the build issues:

```cpp
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
    FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);

    // Generate a filename and mode string
    std::string filename = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(100);
    std::string mode = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);

    // Ensure filename and mode are not empty
    if (filename.empty() || mode.empty()) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Create default TIFFOpenOptions
    TIFFOpenOptions* options = TIFFOpenOptionsAlloc();

    // Call the function-under-test
    TIFF* tiff = TIFFOpenExt(filename.c_str(), mode.c_str(), options);

    // If TIFF* is not null, close it
    if (tiff) {
        TIFFClose(tiff);
    }

    // Free the TIFFOpenOptions
    TIFFOpenOptionsFree(options);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Fixes:
1. **Include Missing Header for `strcpy`**: The `cstring` header is included to ensure that the `strcpy` function is available if needed.
2. **Ensure Non-Empty Filename and Mode**: The code already ensures that the filename and mode are not empty, which is important to avoid passing empty strings to `TIFFOpenExt`.

By including the necessary headers and ensuring non-empty inputs, the code should now compile and run correctly for fuzzing.

<h3>Code #3</h3>

<pre>
Certainly! Below is the fixed code. I have identified the necessary includes and fixed any potential issues related to the undeclared identifiers or unknown type names.

```cpp
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;

// Ensure the TIFFOpenExt and TIFFOpenOptions functions are declared
extern &#34;C&#34; {
    TIFF* TIFFOpenExt(const char* name, const char* mode, TIFFOpenOptions* options);
    TIFFOpenOptions* TIFFOpenOptionsAlloc();
    void TIFFOpenOptionsFree(TIFFOpenOptions* options);
}

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
    FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);

    // Generate a filename and mode string
    std::string filename = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(100);
    std::string mode = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);

    // Ensure filename and mode are not empty
    if (filename.empty() || mode.empty()) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Create default TIFFOpenOptions
    TIFFOpenOptions* options = TIFFOpenOptionsAlloc();

    // Call the function-under-test
    TIFF* tiff = TIFFOpenExt(filename.c_str(), mode.c_str(), options);

    // If TIFF* is not null, close it
    if (tiff) {
        TIFFClose(tiff);
    }

    // Free the TIFFOpenOptions
    TIFFOpenOptionsFree(options);

    return 0;
}
```

### Explanation of Changes:
1. **Include Necessary Headers**: The code already includes the necessary headers for `tiffio.h` and `fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h`.
2. **Ensure Function Declarations**: Added `extern &#34;C&#34;` block to declare the `TIFFOpenExt`, `TIFFOpenOptionsAlloc`, and `TIFFOpenOptionsFree` functions, which might not be declared in the included headers.
3. **Check for Empty Strings**: The original code already checks if the `filename` or `mode` strings are empty before proceeding. This ensures that the function under test gets valid inputs.

This should resolve any build issues related to undeclared identifiers or unknown type names and ensure the code is ready for fuzzing.
