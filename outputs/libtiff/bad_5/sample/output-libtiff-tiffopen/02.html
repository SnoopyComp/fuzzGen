<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;solution&gt;
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
    FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);

    // Generate a filename and mode string
    std::string filename = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(100);
    std::string mode = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);

    // Ensure filename and mode are not empty
    if (filename.empty()) {
        filename = &#34;/tmp/test.tiff&#34;; // Use a default filename if empty
    }
    if (mode.empty()) {
        mode = &#34;r&#34;; // Default to read mode if empty
    }

    // Write fuzz data to a temporary file
    FILE *file = fopen(filename.c_str(), &#34;wb&#34;);
    if (file) {
        std::vector&lt;uint8_t&gt; file_data = fuzzed_data.ConsumeBytes&lt;uint8_t&gt;(size);
        fwrite(file_data.data(), 1, file_data.size(), file);
        fclose(file);
    }

    // Call the function-under-test
    TIFF *tiff = TIFFOpen(filename.c_str(), mode.c_str());

    // Perform any necessary cleanup
    if (tiff) {
        TIFFClose(tiff);
    }

    // Remove the temporary file
    remove(filename.c_str());

    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;
/src/libtiff/contrib/oss-fuzz/tiff_read_rgba_fuzzer.cc:1:1: error: expected unqualified-id
    1 | &lt;solution&gt;
      | ^
&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
&lt;solution&gt;
</pre>



<h3>Code #1</h3>

<pre>
Here is the corrected code with the necessary fixes applied:

```cpp
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
    FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);

    // Generate a filename and mode string
    std::string filename = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(100);
    std::string mode = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);

    // Ensure filename and mode are not empty
    if (filename.empty()) {
        filename = &#34;/tmp/test.tiff&#34;; // Use a default filename if empty
    }
    if (mode.empty()) {
        mode = &#34;r&#34;; // Default to read mode if empty
    }

    // Write fuzz data to a temporary file
    FILE *file = fopen(filename.c_str(), &#34;wb&#34;);
    if (file) {
        std::vector&lt;uint8_t&gt; file_data = fuzzed_data.ConsumeBytes&lt;uint8_t&gt;(size);
        fwrite(file_data.data(), 1, file_data.size(), file);
        fclose(file);
    }

    // Call the function-under-test
    TIFF *tiff = TIFFOpen(filename.c_str(), mode.c_str());

    // Perform any necessary cleanup
    if (tiff) {
        TIFFClose(tiff);
    }

    // Remove the temporary file
    remove(filename.c_str());

    return 0;
}
```

The error in the original code was due to the incorrect `&lt;solution&gt;` and `&lt;/solution&gt;` tags. These tags are not valid in C++ and were causing a syntax error. By removing these tags, the code should now compile correctly.
