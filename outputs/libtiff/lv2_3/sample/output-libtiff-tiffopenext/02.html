<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;solution&gt;
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
    FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);

    // Generate a filename and mode string
    std::string filename = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(100);
    std::string mode = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);

    // Ensure filename and mode are not empty
    if (filename.empty()) {
        filename = &#34;default.tiff&#34;;
    }
    if (mode.empty()) {
        mode = &#34;r&#34;;
    }

    // Create default TIFFOpenOptions
    TIFFOpenOptions* options = TIFFOpenOptionsAlloc();

    // Call the function-under-test
    TIFF* tiff = TIFFOpenExt(filename.c_str(), mode.c_str(), options);

    // If TIFF* is not null, close it
    if (tiff) {
        TIFFClose(tiff);
    }

    // Free the TIFFOpenOptions
    TIFFOpenOptionsFree(options);

    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;
/src/libtiff/contrib/oss-fuzz/tiff_read_rgba_fuzzer.cc:1:1: error: expected unqualified-id
    1 | &lt;solution&gt;
      | ^
&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
&lt;solution&gt;
</pre>



<h3>Code #1</h3>

<pre>
Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;cstdio&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
    FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);

    // Generate a filename and mode string
    std::string filename = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(100);
    std::string mode = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);

    // Ensure filename and mode are not empty
    if (filename.empty()) {
        filename = &#34;default.tiff&#34;;
    }
    if (mode.empty()) {
        mode = &#34;r&#34;;
    }

    // Create default TIFFOpenOptions
    TIFFOpenOptions* options = TIFFOpenOptionsAlloc();

    // Call the function-under-test
    TIFF* tiff = TIFFOpenExt(filename.c_str(), mode.c_str(), options);

    // If TIFF* is not null, close it
    if (tiff) {
        TIFFClose(tiff);
    }

    // Free the TIFFOpenOptions
    TIFFOpenOptionsFree(options);

    return 0;
}
```

The main issue in the provided code was the extraneous `&lt;solution&gt;` tags which were causing syntax errors. Removing these tags resolves the issue. The rest of the code remains unchanged as it correctly uses the `TIFFOpenExt` and other libtiff functions.
