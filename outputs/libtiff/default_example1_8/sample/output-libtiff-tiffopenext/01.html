<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;solution&gt;

#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &lt;cstddef&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Consume input data for the parameters
  std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(100);
  std::string mode = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);

  // Initialize TIFFOpenOptions
  TIFFOpenOptions* options = TIFFOpenOptionsAlloc();
  if (!options) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Call the function-under-test
  TIFF* tiff = TIFFOpenExt(filename.c_str(), mode.c_str(), options);

  // Clean up
  if (tiff) {
    TIFFClose(tiff);
  }
  TIFFOpenOptionsFree(options);

  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;
/src/libtiff/contrib/oss-fuzz/tiff_read_rgba_fuzzer.cc:1:1: error: expected unqualified-id
    1 | &lt;solution&gt;
      | ^
&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
&lt;solution&gt;
</pre>



<h3>Code #1</h3>

<pre>
Here is the fixed code:

```cpp
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &lt;cstddef&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t* data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

  // Consume input data for the parameters
  std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(100);
  std::string mode = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);

  // Initialize TIFFOpenOptions
  TIFFOpenOptions* options = TIFFOpenOptionsAlloc();
  if (!options) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Call the function-under-test
  TIFF* tiff = TIFFOpenExt(filename.c_str(), mode.c_str(), options);

  // Clean up
  if (tiff) {
    TIFFClose(tiff);
  }
  TIFFOpenOptionsFree(options);

  return 0;
}
```

The initial issue was due to the presence of `&lt;solution&gt;` tags which are not valid C++ syntax and were causing a compilation error. Removing these tags fixes the issue. The rest of the code remains unchanged and should compile correctly.
