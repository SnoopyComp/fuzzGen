<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;solution&gt;
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);

  // Generate a filename and mode string
  std::string filename = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(100);
  std::string mode = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);

  // Ensure filename and mode are not empty
  if (filename.empty() || mode.empty()) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Create default TIFFOpenOptions
  TIFFOpenOptions* options = TIFFOpenOptionsAlloc();

  // Call the function-under-test
  TIFF* tiff = TIFFOpenExt(filename.c_str(), mode.c_str(), options);

  // If TIFF* is not null, close it
  if (tiff) {
    TIFFClose(tiff);
  }

  // Free the TIFFOpenOptions
  TIFFOpenOptionsFree(options);

  return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;
/src/libtiff/contrib/oss-fuzz/tiff_read_rgba_fuzzer.cc:1:1: error: expected unqualified-id
    1 | &lt;solution&gt;
      | ^
&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
&lt;solution&gt;
</pre>



<h3>Code #1</h3>

<pre>
Here is the fixed code:

```cpp
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
#include &lt;vector&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
  FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);

  // Generate a filename and mode string
  std::string filename = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(100);
  std::string mode = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);

  // Ensure filename and mode are not empty
  if (filename.empty() || mode.empty()) {
    return 0;
  }

  // Create default TIFFOpenOptions
  TIFFOpenOptions* options = TIFFOpenOptionsAlloc();

  // Call the function-under-test
  TIFF* tiff = TIFFOpenExt(filename.c_str(), mode.c_str(), options);

  // If TIFF* is not null, close it
  if (tiff) {
    TIFFClose(tiff);
  }

  // Free the TIFFOpenOptions
  TIFFOpenOptionsFree(options);

  return 0;
}
```

The main issue in the original code was the presence of the `&lt;solution&gt;` tags, which are not valid C++ syntax and caused a compilation error. Removing these tags resolves the issue, allowing the code to compile correctly. The rest of the code is unchanged and should function as intended for fuzzing purposes.
