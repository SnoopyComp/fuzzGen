<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;solution&gt;

#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
    FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

    // Generate a random filename and mode for TIFFOpen
    std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(20);
    std::string mode = stream.PickValueInArray({&#34;r&#34;, &#34;w&#34;, &#34;a&#34;, &#34;r+&#34;, &#34;w+&#34;, &#34;a+&#34;});

    // Ensure the strings are null-terminated
    filename.push_back(&#39;\0&#39;);
    mode.push_back(&#39;\0&#39;);

    // Call TIFFOpen with the generated filename and mode
    TIFF *tif = TIFFOpen(filename.c_str(), mode.c_str());

    // If the file was successfully opened, close it
    if (tif != nullptr) {
        TIFFClose(tif);
    }

    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;
/src/libtiff/contrib/oss-fuzz/tiff_read_rgba_fuzzer.cc:1:1: error: expected unqualified-id
    1 | &lt;solution&gt;
      | ^
&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
&lt;solution&gt;
</pre>



<h3>Code #1</h3>

<pre>
Here is the complete and fixed code:

```cpp
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;cstring&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
    FuzzedDataProvider stream(data, size);

    // Generate a random filename and mode for TIFFOpen
    std::string filename = stream.ConsumeRandomLengthString(20);
    std::string mode = stream.PickValueInArray({&#34;r&#34;, &#34;w&#34;, &#34;a&#34;, &#34;r+&#34;, &#34;w+&#34;, &#34;a+&#34;});

    // Ensure the strings are null-terminated
    filename.push_back(&#39;\0&#39;);
    mode.push_back(&#39;\0&#39;);

    // Call TIFFOpen with the generated filename and mode
    TIFF *tif = TIFFOpen(filename.c_str(), mode.c_str());

    // If the file was successfully opened, close it
    if (tif != nullptr) {
        TIFFClose(tif);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

The main issue was the `&lt;solution&gt;` tag at the beginning of the code, which is not valid C++ syntax. Removing it resolves the build error. The rest of the code remains unchanged.
