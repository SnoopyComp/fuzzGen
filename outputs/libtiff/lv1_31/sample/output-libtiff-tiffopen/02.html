<h3>Fixer prompt #1</h3>
<pre>

Given the following C++ fuzz harness and its build error message, fix the code to make it build for fuzzing.

If there is undeclared identifier or unknown type name error, fix it by finding and including the related libraries.

MUST RETURN THE FULL CODE, INCLUDING UNCHANGED PARTS.

Below is the code needs to be built:
&lt;code&gt;
&lt;solution&gt;
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
    // Initialize FuzzedDataProvider with the input data
    FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);

    // Consume a string for the file name
    std::string filename = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(100);

    // Consume a string for the mode
    std::string mode = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);

    // Ensure the mode string is not empty and has a valid mode character
    if (mode.empty() || (mode.find_first_of(&#34;rwa+&#34;) == std::string::npos)) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Call the function-under-test
    TIFF *tiff = TIFFOpen(filename.c_str(), mode.c_str());

    // If TIFFOpen succeeded, close the TIFF file
    if (tiff != nullptr) {
        TIFFClose(tiff);
    }

    return 0;
}
&lt;/code&gt;

Below is the error to fix:
The code has the following build issues:
&lt;error&gt;
/src/libtiff/contrib/oss-fuzz/tiff_read_rgba_fuzzer.cc:1:1: error: expected unqualified-id
    1 | &lt;solution&gt;
      | ^
&lt;/error&gt;




Fix code:
1. Consider possible solutions for the issues listed above.
2. Choose a solution that can maximize fuzzing result, which is utilizing the function under test and feeding it not null input.
3. Apply the solutions to the original code.
It&#39;s important to show the complete code, not only the fixed line.
&lt;solution&gt;
</pre>



<h3>Code #1</h3>

<pre>
Here is the fixed code:

```cpp
#include &lt;fuzzer/FuzzedDataProvider.h&gt;
#include &lt;tiffio.h&gt;
#include &lt;cstdint&gt;
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

extern &#34;C&#34; int LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput(const uint8_t *data, size_t size) {
    // Initialize FuzzedDataProvider with the input data
    FuzzedDataProvider fuzzed_data(data, size);

    // Consume a string for the file name
    std::string filename = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(100);

    // Consume a string for the mode
    std::string mode = fuzzed_data.ConsumeRandomLengthString(10);

    // Ensure the mode string is not empty and has a valid mode character
    if (mode.empty() || (mode.find_first_of(&#34;rwa+&#34;) == std::string::npos)) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Call the function-under-test
    TIFF *tiff = TIFFOpen(filename.c_str(), mode.c_str());

    // If TIFFOpen succeeded, close the TIFF file
    if (tiff != nullptr) {
        TIFFClose(tiff);
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Changes made:
1. Removed the `&lt;solution&gt;` and `&lt;/solution&gt;` tags which were causing the build issues.
